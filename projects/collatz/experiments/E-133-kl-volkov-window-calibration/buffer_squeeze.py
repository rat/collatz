E-133, part 5: how much does the truncation extrapolation itself cost?

The deepest decades of the deep run have the fewest buffers above them, so
their Aitken step is the least constrained: at decade 1e11->1e12 with
buffers to 1e17, the three points feeding Aitken sit only 3, 4 and 5
decades above the decade's top. The bootstrap band on those decades
measures root resampling and says nothing about this.

So take a decade that has nine buffers, redo its Aitken using only the
three buffers that reproduce the deep decades' headroom, and compare. The
difference is the extrapolation error the deep decades are exposed to.
